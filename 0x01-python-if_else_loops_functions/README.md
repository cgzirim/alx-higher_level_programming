# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
In this project, I began utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and `for loops`. I wrote my own Python functions in practice while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
